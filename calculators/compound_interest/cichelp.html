<span class=FontFour>Given the opening balance, interest rate, and the number of days the investment is held, <STRONG>Compound Interest Calculator</STRONG> will compute the effective rate of interest, compounded rate of return, and the compounded amount. Conversely, given the compounded amount desired, interest rate, and the number of days the investment is held, <STRONG>Compound Interest Calculator</STRONG> will compute the effective rate of interest, compounded rate of return, and the opening balance.</span><br>
<br>

<span class=FontFour>To use <STRONG>Compound Interest Calculator</STRONG>, simply enter the desired values in the boxes provided. Do not use any punctuation marks, including dollar signs, commas, and percentage signs. For example, say you wanted to calculate the effective rate of interest, compounded rate of return, and the compounded amount based on a 365-day year for a certificate of deposit where the beginning balance is $10,000, the nominal interest rate is 5%, you hold the CD for 180 days, and the interest is compounded daily. You would choose "Caclulate the Compounded Amount" option, choose the "Base Calculations on a 365-Day Year" option, enter 10000 in the Principal box, 5 in the Nominal Interest Rate box, 180 in the Number of Days box, and choose the "Compound on a Daily Basis" option. When you click the calculate button, your result appears along with the values you entered.</span><br>
<br>
 
<span class=FontFour><STRONG>Please note:</STRONG> Do not enter negative values. If you do, <STRONG>Compound Interest Calculator</STRONG> will automatically enter a zero for that value, and will provide you with unreliable results.</span><br>
<br>

<span class=FontFour>If you wish to make another calculation, just click on the Recalculate button. And if you make an error inputting your values, simply click on the Reset button to start over.</span><br>

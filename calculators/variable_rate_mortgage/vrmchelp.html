<br>

<span class=FontFour>Given the principal and the life of the loan, <STRONG>Mortgage Calculator</STRONG> will calculate your monthly mortgage payment throughout the life of the loan, changing as the variable interest rate changes, as well as total interest paid on the loan, and provide you with a complete amortization schedule.</span><br>
<br>

<span class=FontFour>To use <STRONG>Mortgage Calculator</STRONG>, simply enter the desired values in the boxes provided. Do not use any punctuation marks, including dollar signs, commas, and percentage signs. For example, to calculate the payment on a 30-year loan of $355,000, you would enter 355000 in the loan amount box and 360 in the months box (for 30 years). When you click the calculate button, your result appears along with the values you entered.</span><br>
<br>
 
<span class=FontFour><STRONG>Please note:</STRONG> Do not enter negative values. If you do, <STRONG>Mortgage Calculator</STRONG> will automatically enter a zero for that value, and will provide you with unreliable results.</span><br>
<br>

<span class=FontFour><STRONG>Please note:</STRONG> If you are calculating a long-term loan (any loan more than ten years), it could take up to 10 seconds or more to complete the amortization table. Since this is the case, you may get a message from your browser to terminate the script because it is causing the browser to run slowly. Please click NO to this message. If you click yes, you will get unreliable results.</span><br>
<br>

<span class=FontFour>If you wish to calculate another loan with different values, just click on the Recalculate button. And if you make an error inputting your values, simply click on the Reset button to start over.</span><br>

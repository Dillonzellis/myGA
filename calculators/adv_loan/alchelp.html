<span class=FontFour>Given the principal, interest rate, and the life of the loan, <STRONG>Advanced Loan Calculator</STRONG> will calculate your loan payment based on a compounding period of your own choosing (either weekly, monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly, or annually), total interest paid on the loan, and provide you with a complete amortization schedule.</span><br>
<br>

<span class=FontFour>To use <STRONG>Advanced Loan Calculator</STRONG>, simply enter the desired values in the boxes provided. Do not use any punctuation marks, including dollar signs, commas, and percentage signs. For example, to calculate the payment on a five-year loan of $35,000 that is paid and compounds on a monthly basis and is at an 8.5% annual interest rate, you would enter 35000 in the loan amount box, 8.5 in the interest rate box, 5 in the numbers of years box, and 12 in the number of periods box, and you would selected "monthly" as the compounding period. (If you wish to enter an additional payment to principal per period, enter that amount in the appropriate box.) When you click the calculate button, your result appears along with the values you entered.</span><br>
<br>
 
<span class=FontFour><STRONG>Please note:</STRONG> Do not enter negative values. If you do, <STRONG>Advanced Loan Calculator</STRONG> will automatically enter a zero for that value, and will provide you with unreliable results.</span><br>
<br>

<span class=FontFour><STRONG>Please note:</STRONG> If you are calculating a long-term loan (any loan more than ten years), it could take up to 10 seconds or more to complete the amortization table. Since this is the case, you may get a message from your browser to terminate the script because it is causing the browser to run slowly. Please click NO to this message. If you click yes, you will get unreliable results.</span><br>
<br>

<span class=FontFour>If you wish to calculate another loan with different values, just click on the Recalculate button. And if you make an error inputting your values, simply click on the Reset button to start over.</span><br>

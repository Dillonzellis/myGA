<span class=FontFour>Given the principal, interest rate, the life of a loan, and a buyer(s)' income and debt, <STRONG>Loan Qualifier</STRONG> can determine if the buyer(s) qualify for the loan.</span><br>
<br>

<span class=FontFour>To use <STRONG>Loan Qualifier</STRONG>, simply enter the desired values in the boxes provided. Do not use any punctuation marks, including dollar signs, commas, and percentage signs. For example, to determine whether a buyer(s) qualify for a $250,000 loan at an 8% interest rate and a 30-year loan period, where the buyer(s) gross monthly income is $6,500, their monthly real estate liabilities are $150, their homeonwer's insurance is $150, their PMI and HOA dues are $100, their car payments are $200, their credit card payments are $100, you would enter 250000 in the loan amount box, 8 in the interest rate box, 360 in the number of months box, 6500 in the buyer(s)' monthly income box, 150 in the real estate liabilities box, 150 in the homeowner's insurance box, 100 in the PMI and HOA dues box, 200 in the car payments box, and 100 in the credit card payments box. When you click the calculate button, your results appears along with the values you entered.</span><br>
<br>
 
<span class=FontFour><STRONG>Please note:</STRONG> Do not enter negative values. If you do, <STRONG>Loan Qualifier</STRONG> will automatically enter a zero for that value, and will provide you with unreliable results.</span><br>
<br>

<span class=FontFour>If you wish to calculate another loan with different values, just click on the Recalculate button. And if you make an error inputting your values, simply click on the Reset button to start over.</span><br>

      ><strong class="highlight-700">DISCLOSURE:</strong> By participating in
      MyGeorgia Credit Union’s Skip-A-Pay program, you agree and understand that
      <strong class="highlight-700">(1)</strong> Finance charges will continue
      to accrue at the rate of your original loan agreement.
      <strong class="highlight-700">(2)</strong> Finance charges for the skipped
      month will be included in the following month’s payment.
      <strong class="highlight-700">(3)</strong> Skipping a payment will result
      in higher total finance charges than if you made the payments as
      originally scheduled. <strong class="highlight-700">(4)</strong> Skipping
      a payment will cause the term of the loan to be extended past when the
      loan would have otherwise been paid off.
      <strong class="highlight-700">(5)</strong> You are required to resume your
      regular monthly payments the month following the month skipped.
      <strong class="highlight-700">(6)</strong> If you elected GAP or extended
      warranty coverage, the coverage will not be extended beyond the original
      maturity date of the loan. <strong class="highlight-700">(7)</strong> If
      you elected Credit Life/Disability insurance, premiums will be charged as
      normal based on the balance of your loan at the end of the month.
      <strong class="highlight-700">(8)</strong> Only one Skip-A-Pay is allowed
      per loan per year.</small

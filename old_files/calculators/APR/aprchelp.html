<span class=FontFour>Given the loan amount, interest rate, number of years, origination fee percentage, discount points percentage, prepaid interest, and lender's fees, <STRONG>APR Calculator </STRONG> will compute the payment amount, the total loan fees, and the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) of the proposed loan.</span><br>
<br>

<span class=FontFour>To use <STRONG>APR Calculator</STRONG>, simply enter the desired values in the boxes provided. Do not use any punctuation marks, including dollar signs, commas, and percentage signs. For example, say you wanted to calculate payment amount, the total loan fees, and the APR of a 30-year loan for $250,000 at an 8% interest rate with an origination fee of 1%, discount points totalling 0.5%, prepaid interest of $500, and lender's fees totalling $750. You would enter 250000 in the Loan Amount box, 8 in the Interest Rate box, 30 in the Number of Years box, choose 1.000% in the Origination Fee box, choose 0.500% in the Discount Points box, enter 500 in the Prepaid Interest box, and enter 750 in the Lender's Fees box. When you click the calculate button, your results appear along with the values you entered.</span><br>
<br>
 
<span class=FontFour><STRONG>Please note:</STRONG> Do not enter negative values. If you do, <STRONG>APR Calculator</STRONG> will automatically enter a zero for that value, and will provide you with unreliable results.</span><br>
<br>

<span class=FontFour>If you wish to make another calculation, just click on the Recalculate button. And if you make an error inputting your values, simply click on the Reset button to start over.</span><br>

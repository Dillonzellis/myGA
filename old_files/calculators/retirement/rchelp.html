<span class=FontFour><STRONG>Retirement Calculator</STRONG> will compute the beginning balance of a retirement account, the annual contibution you must make, and the annual retirement income you will receive given two of the above three elements, your present age, projected retirement age, and projected age when the annual income disbursement will end, and will provide you with a complete retirement schedule over the life of the retirement account's term.</span><br>
<br>

<span class=FontFour><STRONG>Retirement Calculator</STRONG> also allows you to apply the effects of inflation at a rate of your choosing.</span><br>
<br>

<span class=FontFour>To use <STRONG>Retirement Calculator</STRONG>, simply enter the desired values in the boxes provided. Do not use any punctuation marks, including dollar signs, commas, and percentage signs. For example, to calculate the projected annual retirement income where the beginning retirement account balance is $10,000, your annual contribution to the account is $1,000, the projected interest rate is 8%, your present age is 35, your projected retirement age is 65, and 85 is the projected age when you expect to end your annual income withdrawals, you would choose the "Calculate the Annual Income You Will Receive After Retirment" option, enter 10000 in the Beginning Balance box, 8 in the Interest Rate box, 1000 in the Annual Contribution box, 35 in the Present Age box, 65 in the Retirement Age box, and 85 in the Age At Which Retirement Withdrawals Will End box. To apply the effects of a 2% annual inflation rate on the annual contributions, you would check the "Adjust for Inflation" check box and enter a 2 in the Inflation Rate box. To show the annual retirement income in current dollars, check the "Show Annual Income in Current Dollars" check box. When you click the calculate button your result appears along with the values you entered.</span><br>
<br>
 
<span class=FontFour><STRONG>Please note:</STRONG> Do not enter negative values. If you do, <STRONG>Retirement Calculator</STRONG> will automatically enter a zero for that value, and will provide you with unreliable results.</span><br>
<br>

<span class=FontFour><STRONG>Please note:</STRONG> If you are calculating a long-term schedule (any term more than ten years), it could take up to 10 seconds or more to complete the schedule. Since this is the case, you may get a message from your browser to terminate the script because it is causing the browser to run slowly. Please click NO to this message. If you click yes, you will get unreliable results.</span><br>
<br>

<span class=FontFour>If you wish to make another calculation, just click on the Recalculate button. And if you make an error inputting your values, simply click on the Reset button to start over.</span><br>
